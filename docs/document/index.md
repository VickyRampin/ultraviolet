To contribute to this documentation wiki, you can:
1. Use GitHub's Markdown editing interface to create a new branch with your single-page edit, or
2. Clone the repo, make your changes and preview them locally with Jekyll, and push them as a new branch.

If you haven't worked with Jekyll static sites, you may want to read the [general documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). For guidance on our "Just the Docs" theme, see the [theme documentation](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/).

Either way, make sure to commit your local branch with changes and submit a PR to the `main` branch when you're ready.

If you have questions or encounter errors with the docs, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/nyudlts/ultraviolet/issuess) and use the `documentation` issue tag.
