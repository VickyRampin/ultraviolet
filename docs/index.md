# Welcome to the NYU UltraViolet Docs Wiki

UltraViolet ðŸ’œ is a service of the New York University Libraries and New York University IT. UltraViolet provides long-term access to a broad range of NYU-related digital content, including open access data associated with research and scholarly output and data licensed for use by members of the NYU community. UltraViolet is an NYU-specific implementation of the InvenioRDM framework.

Here you'll find guides for participating in our Dev and Metadata sprints. The project-wide service planning documents live, albeit in a messy form, in the [NYU SB3 Google Drive.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q40bQ5bVZYn5_QhxbPDhhIAYZk3R7434?usp=sharing)  

## Application instances

We currently have two instances available for preview:

- [UltraViolet sandbox GCP hosted instance](https://34.66.53.163/) (requires log-in credentials to view, and requires Firefox. Ask NYU DLTS for [credentials](https://nyu.app.box.com/notes/805001772990).)
- [UltraViolet staging instance](https://stagewebapp1.dlib.nyu.edu/) (requires VPN)

## Overview

The UltraViolet codebase lives in the [nyudlts /
ultraviolet](https://github.com/nyudlts/ultraviolet) GitHub repo.  
This site is built by GitHub pages using the files in the `docs` directory of the main UltraViolet repo.
