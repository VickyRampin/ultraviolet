# Welcome to the NYU UltraViolet Docs Wiki!

Here you'll find Markdown guides for participating in our Dev and Metadata sprints.  
Service planning docs live elsewhere. [TO DO: Where?]

## Overview

The UV codebase lives in the [nyudlts /
ultraviolet](https://github.com/nyudlts/ultraviolet) GitHub repo.  
This site is built by GitHub pages using the files in the `docs` directory of the main UV repo.

## Contributing

To contribute to this documentation wiki, you can:
 1. Use GitHub's Markdown editing interface to create a new branch with your single-page edit, or
 2. Clone the repo, make your changes and preview them locally with Jekyll, and push them as a new branch. (More info available [here]().)

Either way, make sure to submit a PR to the `development` branch when you're ready.

If you have questions or encounter errors with the docs, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/nyudlts/ultraviolet/issuess).
